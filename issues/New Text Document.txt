The issue faced is that, 

Migrations are deleted. 
The "create_personal_access_tokens_table" migration is deleted from migration folder 

but when we run artisan migrate command this migration is run and table is created.

Reason: 
It is because a sanctum dependency comes pre-installed in the laravel installation and in that this migration is essentially run.

Remedy:
There are 2 solutions
1. either uninstall sanctum dependency from composer 
	composer remove laravel/sanctum
2. or add a line for ignoring migrations in 
App\Providers\AppServiceProvider.php

	use Laravel\Sanctum\Sanctum;

	public function register()
	{
		Sanctum::ignoreMigrations();
	}
